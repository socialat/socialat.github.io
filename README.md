Many of us create opensource projects but fail to maintain them due to the lack of financial support, motivation, and time. Hence we've created the [Team](https://socialat.github.io/team) of people who are inspired to keep the sprit of opensource development alive.

We're not in the competition of the projects who are doing the same work.

Since many of the projects who have the same motive as we have have been shut down due to the lake of financial support, we're utilizing the Github echo system to sustain this project for long.

This community is not limited to the developers only but designers, advisors, architects, QAs, content writers and others can also participate.

We're still figuring out a robust plan to make this community better. And your suggestions can help us a lot.

Other sub-projects we're working on

* collabs: Submit your project ideas. Some of us will check for similar ideas and let you know if you should really work on that.
* chicken-egg: Submit your newly launched opensource project. And we'll help it to advertise, if it is really worthful.
